We have three sections for Power analysis for ecology discipline. 

Section 1: power analysis for 36 lnRR meta-analyses and corresponding  power analysis for individual data point within each meta-analysis

Section 2: power analysis for 12 lnCVR and lnVR meta-analyses and corresponding  power analysis for individual data point within each meta-analysis

Section3: using three three weighting schemes (i.e. WAAP, PET-PEESE, http://environmentalcomputing.net/meta-analysis/) to evaluate publication bias


## Section 1 & 2 - power analysis for lnRR (Section 1), lnCVR and lnVR (Section 2)

Using multi-level meta-analysis estimate as true effect, we want to calculate two-tailed power for (i) 36 lnRR meta-analytic cases and individual empirical study within each meta-analysis; (ii) 12 lnCVR and lnVR meta-analytic cases 

In addition, we also want to calculate power using three hypothetical true effects (i.e. 5%, 10%, 20% mean differences)

For a pilot, I did Section 1 & 2 simutanelously, and did 1 case for check


## Section 3 - three weighting schemes (i.e. WAAP, PET-PEESE, http://environmentalcomputing.net/meta-analysis/) to evaluate publication bias
